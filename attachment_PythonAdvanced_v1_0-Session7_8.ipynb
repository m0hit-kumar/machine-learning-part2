    "\n",
    "NumPy (short form for Numerical Python) is the most fundamental package designed for scientific computing and data analysis. Most of the other packages such as pandas, statsmodels are built on top of it, and is an important package to know and learn about. At the heart of NumPy is a data structure called **ndarray**. ndarray is a basically a multi-dimensional array that is built specifically for the purpose of numerical data analysis. Python also has array capabilities, but they are more generic. <b>The advantage of using ndarray is that processing is extremely efficient and fast.</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform standard mathematical operations on either individual elements or complete array. The range of functions covered is <b>linear algebra, statistical operations, and other specialized mathematical operations</b>. For our purpose, we need to know about <b>ndarray and the range of mathematical functions that are relevant to our research purpose</b>. If you already know languages such as C, Fortran, then you can integrate NumPy code with code written in these languages and can pass NumPy arrays seamlessly. \n",
    "\n",
    "From an overall perspective, understanding of <b>NumPy will help us in using pandas effectively as it is built on top of NumPy and frequently we will also be using functions of NumPy in research work</b>. In the current session, we will only look at some of the most important features of NumPy. For a full listing of NumPy features, please visit http://wiki.scipy.org/Numpy_Example_List .\n",
